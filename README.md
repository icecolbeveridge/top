Back in the dark ages -- 2000-3 -- I did a PhD in Solar Theory.
I built a sprawling suite of software for figuring out the
magnetic topology of the solar corona using a language called IDL.

It was horrifying.

Every so often, I wonder "what would the suite look like in a proper,
modern language like Go?" and I've finally got myself together enough
to see if I can answer that question.
